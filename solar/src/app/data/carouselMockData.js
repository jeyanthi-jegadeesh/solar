  h1: "No water on Venus",
  h2: "new study",
  p: "The new study fills in a big gap in what the researchers call the water story on Venus. Using computer simulations, the team found that hydrogen atoms in the planet's atmosphere go whizzing into space through a process known as dissociative recombination causing Venus to lose roughly twice as much water every day compared to previous estimates.",

  p: "After starting science operations in February, Japan-led XRISM (X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) studied the monster black hole at the center of galaxy NGC 4151.",

  h1: "Earth-like environment",
  h2: "On ancient Mars",
  p: "A research team using the ChemCam instrument onboard NASA's Curiosity rover discovered higher-than-usual amounts of manganese in lakebed rocks within Gale Crater on Mars, which indicates that the sediments were formed in a river, delta, or near the shoreline of an ancient lake.",

h1: "Possible atmosphere",
h2: "Surrounding rocky exoplanet",
p: "Researchers may have detected atmospheric gases surrounding 55 Cancri e, a hot rocky exoplanet 41 light-years from Earth. This is the best evidence to date for the existence of any rocky planet atmosphere outside our solar system.",

h1: "Elusive stellar light ",
h2: "Black holes",
p: "Astronomers observed the elusive starlight surrounding some of the earliest quasars in the universe. The findings may shed light on how the earliest supermassive black holes became so massive despite having a relatively short amount of cosmic time in which to grow.",

h1: "Hubble views a galaxy",
h2: "Voracious black hole",
p: "Bright, starry spiral arms surround an active galactic center in a new NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of the galaxy NGC 4951. Located in the Virgo constellation, NGC 4951 is located roughly 50 million light-years away from Earth. It's classified as a Seyfert galaxy, which means that it's an extremely energetic type of galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (AGN).",
